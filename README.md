# svg-logo-maker

# Description
The task for this challenge was create a command-line application using node.js so a user can generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. 
The application will prompt the user to enter the following information: 
 -Text up to three characters.
 -Text color (the user can use a color keyword or a hexadecimal number).
 -Select a shape (choices are circle, triangle, and square).
 -Select a color for the shape (the user can use a color keyword or a hexadecimal number).

 The user will then be presented with a new SVG file named logo.svg and will have all the users selected data for the logo.
 Once the user opens the logo.svg in the browser they can view the pixel image that matches the criteria the user entered.

 The application also includes test using Jest for the triangle, circle, and square classes. Once the user runs the function npm test in the command line the test will show passing.
